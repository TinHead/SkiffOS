# Holoiso

This configuration package enables [Holoiso] running in Skiff Core.

It is intended to be used with the Steam Deck but can also be run elsewhere.

```sh
$ export SKIFF_CONFIG=valve/deck,core/holoiso
$ make configure                   # configure the system
$ make compile                     # build the system
```

See the [valve/deck] docs for more information.
